# Mechanic Service API

The Mechanic Service API is a RESTful backend built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL for managing customers, mechanics, service tickets, and inventory parts. It features JWT authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and relational database modeling for real-world service management.

With Swagger documentation, unit testing, and CI/CD integration, it’s designed for scalability, security, and maintainability — following the Flask Application Factory pattern and deployable to Render with PostgreSQL.

  - Many-to-many relationships with extra fields (ServiceTicket ↔ Mechanic via ServiceTicketMechanic)
  - Many-to-many relationships (ServiceTicket ↔ Inventory via ServiceTicketInventory)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Restrict actions based on user roles (mechanic vs. customer)
  - JWT authentication ensures secure endpoints
- **Automatic Validation and Serialization:**
  - Marshmallow schemas validate incoming data and serialize responses
- **Rate Limiting and Caching:**

## Swagger UI

This project includes Swagger documentation to easily explore and test the API.

Once the app is running, visit:
https://project-advanced-api-development.onrender.com/api/docs/#/

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are included for all major functionality using Python’s unittest framework.

Activate your virtual environment:

    source .venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

Run all tests in the app/tests folder:

    python -m unittest discover -s app/tests

Test results will show pass/fail status for each endpoint and function.

### What is Tested

CRUD operations for customers, mechanics, inventories, and service tickets.

Role-based access restrictions.

Service ticket assignments and part usage.

Edge cases like invalid IDs and forbidden actions.

## Swagger CLI and Nodemon

This project uses swagger-cli and nodemon to manage and automatically rebuild the Swagger API documentation.

    swagger-cli – Used to bundle multiple Swagger YAML files into a single merged specification.

    nodemon – Watches files for changes and automatically executes a command when changes are detected.

To run:

    npm run watch-swagger

Whenever you update any Swagger YAML file, the merged specification will automatically regenerate in swagger_build/merged.yaml. You can then view it in Swagger UI.
